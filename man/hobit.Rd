\usage{
hobit(
  x,
  use_Dirichlet = FALSE,
  no_replicate = FALSE,
  eps = 0.001,
  dist = c("NB", "ZINB"),
  n_threads = getOption("mc.cores", 1),
  parallel_chains = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \linkS4class{ExpMX} object containing normalized homeolog
expression data (RNA-Seq read counts).}

\item{use_Dirichlet}{Logical. Whether to apply a Dirichlet prior distribution
when sampling expression ratios.}

\item{no_replicate}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, all replicates are treated as a
single condition when estimating dispersion. This avoids errors in cases
where no biological replicates are available.}

\item{eps}{Numeric. Minimum threshold for homeolog expression. Values below
this threshold are replaced with 0 to avoid instability during MCMC sampling,
especially when fitting NB models with near-zero means.}

\item{dist}{Character. Distribution used to model expression data.
Options: \code{'NB'} (negative binomial) or \code{'ZINB'} (zero-inflated negative
binomial).}

\item{n_threads}{Integer. Number of threads for parallelizing computation
across homeologs. This parallelization is independent of MCMC sampling,
which is controlled by \code{parallel_chains}. Defaults to the global option
\code{'mc.cores'}, or 1 if not set. In practice, using a larger \code{n_threads}
with \code{parallel_chains = 1} typically reduces overall execution time
compared to allocating more threads to MCMC chains.}

\item{parallel_chains}{Integer. Number of parallel MCMC chains. Passed
directly to \code{\link[cmdstanr]{sample}} in the \pkg{cmdstanr} package.
If both \code{n_threads} and \code{parallel_chains} exceed 1, the total number of
threads used is \verb{n_threads × parallel_chains}. Ensure adequate resources
are available before increasing both parameters.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to
\code{\link[cmdstanr]{sample}} (e.g., \code{chains}, \code{iter_warmup},
\code{iter_sampling}, \code{thin}).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per homeolog, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{pvalue}: p-value from the LRT using normalized likelihoods.
\item \code{qvalue}: Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted \code{pvalue}.
\item \code{raw_pvalue}: p-value from the LRT using raw likelihoods.
\item \code{raw_qvalue}: Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted \code{raw_pvalue}.
\item \verb{D__$__*}: Difference in expression ratios for subgenome \code{$}
between the two groups represented by \code{*}.
\item \verb{OR__$__*}: Odds ratio of expression ratios for subgenome \code{$}
between the two groups represented by \code{*}.
\item \code{Dmax}: Maximum absolute difference in expression ratios (\verb{D__$__*})
observed across all subgenomes and group comparisons.
\item \code{ORmax}: Maximum odds ratio in expression ratios (\verb{OR__$__*})
observed across all subgenomes and group comparisons.
\item \verb{theta0__$}: Posterior expression ratio estimates shared
across all conditions, where \code{$} denotes the subgenome name.
\item \verb{theta1__*__$}: Posterior expression ratio estimates specific
to each condition,
where \code{$} denotes the subgenome name and \code{*} denotes the group name.
\item \code{logLik_H0}: Log-likelihood of the reduced model.
\item \code{logLik_H1}: Log-likelihood of the full model.

All statistics are derived from MCMC samples
and may differ from those calculated directly from the RNA-Seq read counts.

\description{
A statistical framework for identifying changes in homeolog expression ratios
across experimental conditions in allopolyploid species.
}
\details{
HOBIT is a statistical test for detecting homeologs with differential
homeolog expression ratios across multiple experimental conditions
in allopolyploid species, using RNA-Seq read count data.
It employs a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to compare two hierarchical models:
a full model that allows HERs to vary among conditions,
and a reduced model that assumes constant ratios across all conditions.

Expression counts are modeled using a negative binomial (NB) distribution.
Specifically, the expression level of a homeolog from the \eqn{i}-th subgenome,
denoted \eqn{x_{i}}, is assumed to follow an NB distribution with mean
\eqn{\mu \theta_{i}} and dispersion \eqn{\phi}, where \eqn{\mu} is the total
gene expression across subgenomes, \eqn{\theta_{i}} is the proportion of
expression attributable to the \eqn{i}-th subgenome, and \eqn{\phi} is the
dispersion parameter:

\deqn{
x_{i} \sim NB(\mu \theta_{i}, \phi)
}

By default, \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}} are sampled from
uninformative priors, while dispersion \eqn{\phi} is estimated using
\code{\link[edgeR]{estimateDisp}} from the \pkg{edgeR} package.

HOBIT uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to fit both the full and
reduced models and compute likelihoods for the LRT. The main entry point is
the \code{hobit()} function, which performs parameter estimation, model fitting,
likelihood computation, and hypothesis testing.
