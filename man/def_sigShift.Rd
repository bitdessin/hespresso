\title{Define Ground-truth Homeologs with Differential Expression Ratios}
\usage{
def_sigShift(
  x,
  base = 0,
  groups = NULL,
  Dmax = 0.15,
  ORmax = 2,
  operator = c("OR", "AND")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \linkS4class{ExpMX}.}

\item{base}{Either \code{0}, a positive integer, or a character string.
Values to specify the subgenome to use as the reference for calculating
Dmax and ORmax. If \code{0}, all subgenomes are used in the calculation.}

\item{groups}{Vector. A character vector of length two specifying the
condition groups to compare.}

\item{Dmax}{Numeric. Homeologs with Dmax values greater than this
threshold are flagged as HER-shifting.}

\item{ORmax}{Numeric. Homeologs with ORmax values greater than this
threshold are flagged as HER-shifting.}

\item{operator}{Character. Either \code{'AND'} or \code{'OR'}, specifying how
the \code{Dmax} and \code{ORmax} criteria are combined to ground-truth homeologs
with differential expression ratios between conditions.}
}
\value{
A logical vector indicating whether each homeolog is classified
as a ground-truth homeolog with differential expression ratios
that satisfy the given thresholds (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).
}
\description{
Defines ground-truth homeologs with differential expression ratios among
subgenomes across multiple conditions in allopolyploid species,
from simulated count data stored in an \linkS4class{ExpMX} object.
}
\details{
An \linkS4class{ExpMX} object generated by \code{sim_homeolog_counts()}
contains the true homeolog expression ratios (HERs), derived from the mean
expression values used to simulate RNA-Seq read counts under a negative
binomial distribution.
This function calculates two summary statistics from these HERs:
\strong{Dmax}, the maximum absolute difference in HERs between two conditions,
and \strong{ORmax}, the maximum odds ratio of HERs across all subgenomes.
Homeologs are classified as significantly HER-shifting if their
Dmax and/or ORmax values exceed the specified thresholds.
