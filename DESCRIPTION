Description:
    hespresso blends homeolog expression with espresso,
    capturing the essence of power, energy, and focus in homeolog expression analysis.
    It provides statistical tests for detecting shifts in homeolog expression ratios
    among subgenomes of allopolyploid species across diverse conditions,
    using RNA-Seq read count data.
