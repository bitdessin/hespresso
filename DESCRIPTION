Description: hespresso blends homeolog expression with
    espresso, capturing the essence of power, energy, and focus in
    homeolog expression analysis. It provides statistical tests for
    detecting shifts in homeolog expression ratios among subgenomes of
    allopolyploid species across diverse conditions, using RNA-seq read
    count data. Take a sip of hespresso, and start your analysis
    strong!
