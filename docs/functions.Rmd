# Functions

The `r pkg("hespresso")` package is designed
to detect homeologs with shifted expression ratios across diverse conditions
using RNA-seq data from allopolyploids.
It provides two methods, HOBIT and HomeoRoq,
which are implemented as the functions `hobit()` and `homeoroq()`, respectively.


```{r fc-sec-hobit, child='functions/hobit.Rmd'}
```


```{r fc-sec-homeoroq, child='functions/homeoroq.Rmd'}
```
