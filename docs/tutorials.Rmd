# Tutorials

This chapter provides step-by-step tutorials demonstrating
the use of `r pkg("hespresso")` with real RNA-Seq datasets from diverse allopolyploids,
including allotetraploid, allohexaploid, and allotriploid.
Workflows cover data preparation, normalization, and statistical testing
with HOBIT or HomeoRoq, illustrating practical strategies
to detect shifts in homeolog expression ratios across developmental stages,
stress treatments, and ecological habitats.
