# Installation

To install the `r pkg("hespresso")` package,
start R (version 4.5 or later) and run the following commands:


```{r installation-package, eval=FALSE}
# CRAN Packages
install.packages(c("remotes", "BiocManager"))

# Bioconductor Packages
BiocManager::install("edgeR")

# cmdstanr
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()

# hespresso
remotes::install_github("bitdessin/hespresso")
```

Because `r pkg("hespresso")` relies on `r pkg("cmdstanr")` [@ref_stan],
which is not available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/),
it cannot be hosted on these repositories,
making the installation slightly more complex than that of typical R packages.
