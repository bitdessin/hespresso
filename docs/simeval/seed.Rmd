## Custom Data Simulation

```{r sim-custom-setup, include=FALSE}
source("../_config.R")
```

Instead of relying on the default datasets based on *C. flexuosa* or wheat,
users can provide their own expression matrix to calculate the mean and dispersion parameters for simulation.
The matrix should have genes as rows and samples (biological replicates) as columns,
with each cell containing a normalized read count.

Below is an example showing
how to load a custom matrix and use it as a template for simulation.

```{r sim-custom-seed}
expmx <- read.table("../data/seed.c_flexuosa.txt.gz")
head(expmx)
x <- sim_homeolog_counts(seed_expmx = expmx)
x
```

This approach enables users to generate simulated datasets
that closely resemble their own study system,
facilitating realistic evaluation of HOBIT or related methods.
