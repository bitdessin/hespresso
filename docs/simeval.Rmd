# Evaluation Framework

This chapter presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating methods
that detect shifts in homeolog expression ratios,
such as HOBIT, using simulated datasets.
It covers generating artificial datasets that mimic allotetraploid and allohexaploid species,
visualizing the ground truth of homeolog expression patterns,
and calculating standard evaluation metrics.
